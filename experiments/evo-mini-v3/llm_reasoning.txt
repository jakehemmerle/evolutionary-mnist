GENERATION 2
======================================================================

Looking at the previous results, I can see a clear pattern:

**Best performer (Config 4)**: LR=0.02, epochs=4, batch_size=16, channels=64, kernel=7, dropout=0.4, fc_hidden=256 → 98.75% accuracy, 0.042 loss

**Key insights:**
- The best config used the **largest kernel (7)**, which likely captured better spatial features
- **Small batch size (16)** seemed beneficial - more stochasticity = better generalization
- **Moderate dropout (0.4)** helped prevent overfitting
- The worst config (3) had **too low learning rate (0.001)** with a smaller network - caused underfitting
- Higher learning rates (0.05) with very large batches worked decently but not as well

**Strategy for generation 2:**
- Build on Config 4's success by exploring variations around those parameters
- Try increasing epochs to 5 to see if more training helps (without overfitting)
- Push kernel_size=7 further (it's the best so far)
- Experiment with slightly higher learning rates in the sweet spot
- Try even smaller batch sizes (more noise = better generalization)
- Vary network capacity to find the right balance

Here are my 4 configurations:

GENERATION 5
======================================================================

Looking at the previous results, I can see clear patterns in what makes configurations perform well:

**Key Findings from Analysis:**
1. **Best configurations consistently use kernel size 7** - All top 8 configs with >99% accuracy use kernel_size=7
2. **Small batch sizes (8) perform best** - The highest accuracies all use batch_size=8
3. **Higher channel counts (96-128)** correlate with better performance
4. **Learning rates around 0.03-0.035 are optimal** - This sweet spot balances convergence speed with stability
5. **Moderate-high dropout (0.38-0.5)** helps prevent overfitting
6. **Larger fc_hidden layers (384-512)** improve capacity
7. **4-5 epochs** provides sufficient training without overfitting

The absolute best result (0.991833) used: lr=0.035, epochs=4, batch_size=8, channels=112, kernel=7, dropout=0.45, fc_hidden=448

My strategy for generation 5 is to explore even more aggressive configurations:
- Push channels to the max (128)
- Test lr slightly below 0.035 (0.028-0.032) to see if we can find another sweet spot
- Extend training to 5 epochs with best configs
- Maintain the optimal kernel_size=7 and batch_size=8
